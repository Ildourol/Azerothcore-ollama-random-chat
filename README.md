Ollama AI Chat Control Module for AzerothCoreOverviewThis module provides critical quality-of-life improvements for integrating Large Language Model (LLM) powered bots, via Ollama, into your AzerothCore server environment.

The primary function of this fix is to eliminate disruptive and excessive chatter from AI bots, specifically addressing scenarios where bots are members of player-led guilds or are active in public channels like "Say" or "World Chat".The Problem SolvedIn previous implementations, AI-driven bots often engaged in high-frequency, random, or contextually irrelevant conversation in general chat channels. This behavior, especially within player guilds, resulted in channel spam, disrupted player immersion, and led to a frustrating user experience.The EnhancementThis updated control module ensures that AI interaction remains valuable and non-intrusive. It introduces filtering and throttling mechanisms that restrict bot responses to appropriate, controlled interactions.

The bots will now only communicate under relevant conditions, such as:Direct Interaction: Responding to whispers or targeted "Say" commands directed specifically at the bot.Controlled Scenarios: Events or predefined triggers, preventing unsolicited noise in large, public communication streams.This maintains the utility of the AI integration (powered by Ollama) while ensuring a clean, engaging, and non-spammy chat environment for actual players.
